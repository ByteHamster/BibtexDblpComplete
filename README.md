# BibtexDblpComplete

This tool takes a bibtex file and tries to complete each entry using the dblp database.
Supports all formats offered by dblp, and an additional format that is based on "condensed" but includes the doi.
If there are multiple search results on dblp, it takes the first one with matching year.

### Usage

Download the jar file attached to the latest release (or build using `mvn package`) and run:

```
java -jar BibtexDblpComplete.jar [FORMAT] FILENAME
```

`FORMAT` can be one of `--condensed`, `--condensed-with-doi`, `--standard`, `--crossref`

### Example interaction
